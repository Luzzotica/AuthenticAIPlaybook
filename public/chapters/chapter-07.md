# Step 1: Input – Feed the AI Your Stories

{{name}} let me tell you a secret.

Many people, myself included, expect AI to simply be able to write like them. This was a huge part of my frustration when working with AI. It always gave me something that was “good” but not great. 

It took me at least 6 months before I realized the error of my ways.

And I realized it while writing a book on Python with ChatGPT over one weekend. 

While writing that book I had to do a TON of upfront work to get each chapter to sound like me. After I was 3-4 chapters in though I was able to say “This is perfect, let’s move on to the next chapter\!” The AI had picked up on my voice. My style. My format. HOW I wanted it to speak\!

I finished the book in 6 hours.

AI can’t sound like you unless it knows you, {{name}}. 

The first step in the **Authentic AI Voice System** is providing the AI with more of *you*. This is where your stories, experiences, proprietary frameworks, results, case studies, and unique perspectives come into play.

#### Why Input Matters

* **Foundation for Authenticity:** Without your stories, the AI can only produce generic content. Feeding it your voice ensures everything it creates reflects your unique perspective.  
* **Tone and Style Naturally Follow:** Your tone and style are embedded in the way you tell your stories. Sharing personal experiences helps the AI replicate your natural way of communicating.  
* **Personalization Drives Connection:** Your audience resonates with content that feels real. Providing the AI with your stories, results, case studies, and unique perspectives ensures it creates content that connects with them on a deeper level.

There are **two core ways** to give the AI more of you:

#### 1\. Have the AI Interview You

This method is perfect if you don’t have existing content to share, {{name}}. AI can ask you questions to draw out your thoughts, stories, and GREATNESS.

* **How to Start:**  
  * Ask ChatGPT or Claude:  
    * “Ask me 20 questions about \[specific topic\].”  
    * “Help me outline a blog post by asking questions about \[subject\].”  
  * Answer the questions in your natural tone, sharing your authentic perspective.  
* **Why It Works:**  
  * The AI learns your tone and style from how you respond.  
  * You uncover insights and stories about your own expertise that you may not have articulated before (this is a big one {{name}}!)

#### 2\. Provide Existing Content

If you have previous content, {{name}}, this is a great way to teach the AI your style and tone. Or to feed it user generated content (results).

* **What to Share:**  
  * Blog posts, emails, or social media posts.  
  * Personal stories, case studies, or testimonials.  
  * Video or audio transcripts.  
* **How to Use It:**  
  * Paste your content into ChatGPT and ask it to use it to help you write something similar.  
  * Example prompt:  
    * “Here’s a blog post I wrote. Use this as a guide to write another post on \[topic\].”

#### Go All Out: Combine Both Methods

For the most effective results, combine both approaches. Have the AI interview you to uncover new insights, and then reinforce it with your existing content.

**This lead magnet is an example of that in action:**  
  1. I answered AI-generated interview questions.  
  2. I provided past stories and examples (from an audio transcript) to guide its tone and structure.

#### Pro Tip for You {{name}}:

The more *you* the AI gets, the more authentically it can write like you. Focus on feeding it your unique voice, and the results will reflect who you truly are. Especially if you combine it with **Templates**.
