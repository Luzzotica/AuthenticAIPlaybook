# Step 2: Structure – Use Templates to Guide Output

When I’m writing content like this I spend a lot of time up front to ensure it starts off right. 

This was true when writing my book on Python. It was true when I was creating my course for beginners on AI. 

It’s true now (writing this). 

After feeding the AI my voice, much of my upfront time is spent figuring out the structure of the content. 

You can skip this problem by using a consistent template (blog posts are a great example). However if you’re just getting started, or you’re working on something fresh, you’ll always have to figure out your template.

Why is this the case {{name}}? 

Because templates are the most powerful tool for defining AI output. 

They provide a clear structure, ensuring your content matches your style and flows naturally. By using templates, you can turn unstructured ideas into polished, professional (or comedic, or whatever style you want) content every time.

And that repeatability is gold.

#### Why Templates Work

* **Consistency:** Templates help ensure your content follows a repeatable format, making it feel cohesive and polished (super important when you land on a winning formula {{name}}).  
* **Clarity:** They guide the AI’s responses, reducing confusion and improving the quality of the output.  
* **Control:** You stay in charge of how your content looks, regardless of the topic or field (this is a big one {{name}}!).

#### How to Use Templates

1. **Use An Example**  
   If you have existing content, feed it to the AI an example of how you want the output to be structures, flow, etc. In the AI field this is called “One Shot” learning. This is the simplest way to get started with templates.  
2. **Provide Specific Instructions**  
   Describe the exact structure you want (it should match the example you provide).  
   * **Example Prompt:**  
     * “Write a blog post with three sections:  
       * An introduction with a personal story.  
       * A middle section explaining a framework.  
       * A conclusion with a call-to-action.”  
3. **Use Output Templates**  
   Define EXACTLY how the information should be presented.  
   * **Example Templates:**  
     * **Social Media Post Template:**

```
90% of {Outcome} is really just:

- {Simple Habit #1}  
- {Simple Habit #2}  
- {Simple Habit #3}

{Punchy finisher}
```

* **Blog Post Template:**

```
### {Intro Header}  
{punchy intro with a fun joke}

### {Educational Header}  
{Educational information/value/testimonial}

### {CTA Header}  
{Call to action}
```

The AI will know to replace things in the curly braces “{}” with its generated content {{name}}. These **Templates** are the most precise way to get AI to copy you. And they are prevalent everywhere. Most writers are already aware of them (and likely have many templates of their own to reduce work).

For example, Justin Welsh uses a template to write his newsletters in less than 45 minutes.

#### Creating Custom Templates

* **Identify Your Content Platform**  
  Think about what you want the AI to produce:  
  * Is it a blog post? Social media post? Email?  
  * Who is your audience, and how do you want to connect with them?  
* **Break Down Your Past Content**  
  Analyze content you’ve already created:  
  * What structure did you use?  
  * What elements made it effective?  
  * Can you turn that into a repeatable template?  
* **Experiment and Adjust**  
  Templates don’t have to be perfect on the first try {{name}}. Start simple and refine as you go (which is a major part of the next step)\!  
* **Use Your Proprietary Frameworks**  
  One of the things I love about experts is **how they think**. As an expert I am CERTAIN that you have frameworks, or mental models that help you succeed in your field {{name}}! Teaching the AI these frameworks, and having it use these to generate content around those frameworks is game changing.

#### Real World Example

While building this lead magnet, each section followed a template!

1. Introduce the step with a story!  
2. How to do it (tactical how)  
3. Proof that it works (in my case just using this lead magnet)  
4. Pro tip

Each of the sections is following this template, which helps the AI write how I want (like me).

After drafting I’m able to get it into a presentable place with (very) minimal editing.

Even the story at the beginning was written with a template. Russel Brunson’s Epiphany Bridge framework was used to guide the AI into writing a compelling story faster than I could have written it myself. It helped both the AI and myself build it out.

#### Side Quest: Frameworks and Mental Models

I’d like to take a moment and double down on this idea of frameworks.

{{name}}, my expert friend. You are amazing at whatever it is you do. It’s why you’re an expert! You have specific ways of **thinking** that enable your success. To get others to replicate you (i.e. to teach others what you do and create results from them) you TEACH THEM HOW TO THINK!

So how do you think you get AI to replicate you? You **TEACH IT HOW TO THINK**!

This is one reason why the interview is so effective. The AI is querying how you think. It’s getting more of YOU into it so that it can start to talk like you by “thinking” like you. Those ways of thinking that you’ve built up over your life are the perfect templates for AI to copy you.

Frameworks, if you have them, are highly organized ways of thinking about and solving a problem. 

So whenever you have the chance, give these to the AI directly so it knows how you operate.

And watch as it sounds exactly like you, {{name}}.

#### Pro Tip for You {{name}}: Steal Other People’s Templates

There are dozens of people online that share their templates:

- [Justin Welsh](https://www.justinwelsh.me/) is a creator that shares 5 new templates every month in a subscription.  
- [TypeShare](https://typeshare.co/) has an entire library of examples.
