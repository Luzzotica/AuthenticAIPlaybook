# The Second Failure

...coaching.

That's right {{name}}. COACHING!!

Helping others. Teaching. Sharing stories and frameworks.  
It felt safe. Human. Uncopyable.

(It also made me go broke. But that's a story for another time.)

Then I made my SECOND mistake, {{name}}.

I *tried* (key word) to use AI to help me write.

And it SUCKED.

Emails felt robotic.  
Social posts were lifeless.  
The words sounded "right"… but they weren’t *mine*.

**So I walked away again.**

Not from coding this time, but from AI altogether.

But the truth?

I didn’t walk away because AI was bad...
