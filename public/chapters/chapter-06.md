# The Authentic AI Voice System

{{name}}, there are 3 steps to get AI to sound like you:

1. **Input: Feed the AI Your Stories**  
   AI can’t sound like you unless it knows you. Your stories—your personal experiences, values, and unique perspectives—are the foundation.   
2. **Structure: Use Templates to Guide Output**  
   Templates act as a roadmap for the AI, ensuring the structure of your content matches your style. With templates, you can have AI format your content into lists, steps, narrative flows, or even use your proprietary frameworks so that the output aligns with your voice. **Templates** are powerful, and by far the most effective tool for defining output, so I’ll show you how to use them step by step.  
3. **Iterate: Refine for Authenticity**  
   The AI won’t get it perfect the first time. By reviewing its output and providing feedback, you can teach it to get closer and closer to your authentic voice.

Let's dive into each step in detail.
